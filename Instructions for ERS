Divide up cards as evenly as possible to players
Players arrange their cards in a deck without looking
While there is no winner
  Players take turns putting down cards face up in a pile
  If a face card is put down:
    If face card is Jack:
      next player puts down one card;
      If the player puts down a face card or ten:
        next player goes;
    Else if face card is Queen:
      for(int i=0; i<2; i++)
      next player puts down one card;
      If card was face card or ten:
        next player goes;
    Else if face card is King:
      next player puts down three cards;
      If the player puts down a face card or ten:
        next player goes;
    Else if face card is Ace:
      next player puts down four cards;
      If the player puts down a face card or ten:
        next player goes;
  If a combination of cards appears that was predecided upon appears:
    first player who slaps the pile gets the pile and starts next round.;
  If a player slaps on a combination of cards not predecided upon:
    player takes top card from deck and puts face down on bottom of the pile.;
  If one player has all the cards:
    game ends and that player wins.;
